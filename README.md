An android app that can

- Connect to a Concept2 PM5 over bluetooth and dump the workout data in a text file (in a format that is identical to the command-line output of `gatttool`)
- Read data from the accelerometer in the direction of the Y axis, compress it and dump it in a binary file, and calculate the rowing rate and display it.
- Connect to a heart rate monitor over bluetooth, display the heart rate, and dump the data in a text file.
